# Chromafari
My growing list of Chrome extensions that I ported to Safari for macOS. Designed to work on Intel and Apple Silicon on most modern versions of macOS.

# Download
Visit [this page](https://8itcat.github.io/chromafari/) to download specific extensions or clone this repository to download them all.

# Why?
Well, to put it simply, extensions on Safari suck and break with new Safari updates. With this repo I hope to make Safari a little bit more usable since all-in-all it is a great browser.

# FAQ

### 'X' Extension isn't working on 'Y' version of macOS!
- I can't keep track of whether or not my extensions work on every OS. If you have a relatively modern version of macOS these extensions should work, unless otherwise noted. Please create an [issue](https://github.com/8itCat/Chromafari/issues) if something doesn't work for you

### Is this legal?
- Short answer: No. Long answer: I don't own any copywrights or trademarks for any of these extensions so technically this can be seen as illegal. You won't go to jail for using these extensions, though.

### Why not on the Mac App Store?
- Two reasons: 
  1) I don't have an Apple Developer Account
  2) Once again, I don't have legal access to republish these extensions

# Credits
